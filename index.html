        <h2>A few facts about the Hibiscus</h2>
        <img src="Hibiscus.jpg" width="400">

            <p>There are many types of hibiscus. 
                This growing guide covers perennial 
                hibiscus grown for their strikingly-beautiful, big, disc-shaped, 
                hollyhock-like flowers that can measure up to 12 inches across!
                Perennial hibiscus can grow up to eight feet tall, but there are 
                also dwarf varieties of only two to three feet tall. 
            </p>

        <h2>When to Plant Hibiscus:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Hibiscus can be purchased as young plants from nurseries and are best planted in the spring. 
                    Or, they can be rooted from a cutting in the spring.</li> 
                <li>If you wish to grow hibiscus from seed, sow indoors 12 weeks before the last spring frost date.</li> 
                <li>Soak seeds in very warm water for one hour before sowing. 
                    Alternatively, seeds can be sown outdoors after the last expected frost date.</li> 
            </ul>

        <h3>Facts about Hibiscus</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Hibiscus plants produce some of the most showy blossoms of summer, with their huge bursts of red, orange, pink and yellow.  
                We love these flowers for their huge size and vibrant color, but also as a pollinator-friendly plant â€” birds, butterflies and bees all love them!</li>
            <li>Hibiscus NEED sun to blossom.  
                Make sure your plants, whether tropical or hardy, are positioned to get at least 6 hours of sun per day in order to set buds and eventually blossom.</li>
            <li>Hibiscus flowers can be made into tea, which is a good source of Vitamin C.</li>
